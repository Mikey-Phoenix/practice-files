            <h3>How To Play</h3>
            <p>Once the <span class="yellow">Start</span> button is clicked you will be given six cards to play with. To play, click on any card until the card is slightly raised from the others. Once that is completed click on the card in the center of the page to complete your play. If you don't have a card to play just click the card with an <span class="yellow">A</span> in the middle beside the card in the center to pick another card, this will cause you to lose a turn.</p>
            <h3>Rules Of The Game</h3>
            <p>Once a card is placed in the center of page you can only play a card with an element that is the same or the element next to what it on the avatar cycle or a card with the symbols of all four elements symbolizing the avatar.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Be careful of the number on th card you play, playing a card with number less than what is on the deck will award you a loss. This means to stay in the game you have to play a card with a number greater than the number on the card you're playing on. This rule applies to all cards that do not have all four elements on it.</p>
